# Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim_source
Open source code for Ama's FF14 Combat Sim.

# Quick start
If you would like to run the sim but do not want to install it, go to the [Python Notebook Github](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim) and follow the instruction to open and use *CoreSimulator.ipynb*.

If you would like to install the sim to run locally, run ```pip install ama-xiv-combat-sim``` on your machine to install the core packages. You may want to refer to some of the code in the [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim/blob/main/CoreSimulator.ipynb) to grab some visualization/plotting code that visualizes the sim's output.

# About
This open-source package simulates the damage of given gearsets and rotations, producing the full distributions over damage values and various statistics, like the expected max damage over N runs (useful for parsers). Currently, all lvl 90 standard combat classes are supported (lvl 100 and Dawntrail support will come in the future, after Dawntrail is released). For issues/feature requests and news, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/CV6sHj8h9D) server.

Unlike other simulators/spreadsheets, this gives more than just expected damage with an approximation of damage variance- this is an accurate [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation that gives the full range and distribution over all possible damage values. This tool is an installable pip package, and is also in a standalone [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim/blob/main/CoreSimulator.ipynb) that can be run on Google's Colab in 2 mouse clicks.

The sim's main computation engine is written in Numpy, relying on parallelized matrix-based computations for the heavy lifting. It runs fairly fast (a typical ~30s opener with 1M samples takes about 1-2 seconds on a single CPU).

The tool has four advantages over existing simulators/spreadsheets:

1) handles the simulation of all FF14 job classes in a single place- no need to maintain multiple spreadsheets, etc.,

2) incorporates all damage rolls and crit/dh procs on a per-damage-instance basis, and rolls them every time the sim is run,

3) enables the building of several useful community tools that either don't exist, or can be streamlined, using this sim as a backend, and

4) allows for the incorporation of procs in the simulation process itself.

Some examples of useful tools is a *kill time estimator*, that takes a 1) full 8-player rotation including LB usage, and 2) a target boss HP values, and outputs a distribution over expected kill times. To see a demonstration of this and other capabilities built on top of the sim, please refer to the [Python Notebook Github](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim).

# Usage

## Imports
After installation, make sure to *import ama-xiv-combat-sim* so that paths, etc. are set up. After this, you can import sub-packages/functions/files as you wish, and use them. Rotations can be specified both in code in the sim itself, and by passing in CSV files.

## Example Single Target, Single Player rotation, typed directly into the sim.
```
